            <h1>Alan Turing: Creator of modern computing</h1>
            <br/>
            <h2>Alan Turing was not a well known figure during his lifetime.</h2>
            <br />
            <p>But today he is famous for being an eccentric yet passionate British mathematician, who conceived modern computing and played a crucial part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in WW2.
            <br />
            He was also a victim of mid-20th Century attitudes to homosexuality â€“ he was chemically castrated before dying at the age of 41.</p>
